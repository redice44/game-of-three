# One Week

## The Project

Create a simple implementaiton of Game of Three from [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) [Easy #239](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3r7wxz/20151102_challenge_239_easy_a_game_of_threes/).

> A simple game where the objective is to increment or decrement a number so that it is divisible by three. The game ends when you reach 1. 

## Planning

Simple wireframes were sketched before the Photoshop design was made.

## Review

The project was an interesting learning experience. It was the first time that I ever wireframed and made a photoshop design. The actual game development was not difficult. I have had some experience setting up NodeJS and ExpressJS servers, and although not really needed. I decided to implement it in this fashion.

I did not get around to implementing the [Zero Sum](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3rhzdj/20151104_challenge_239_intermediate_a_zerosum/) mode. 

## Thoughts

> One week is not a lot of time.

There are plenty of opportunities for improvement in this project. It will almost certainly be a project that I revisit in another One Week or just in some free time, but I am satisified with how it turned out as the first One Week project.
